## For Copilot Agent

### Technical Implementation Areas
- [ ] Frontend UI components (`src/static/index.html`, `src/static/styles.css`)
- [ ] JavaScript functionality (`src/static/app.js`)
- [ ] Backend API endpoints (`src/backend/routers/`)
- [ ] Database schema changes (`src/backend/database.py`)
- [ ] Authentication/authorization (`src/backend/routers/auth.py`)

### Development Approach
- [ ] Break down the feature into smaller, manageable components
- [ ] Design database changes first (if needed)
- [ ] Implement backend API endpoints
- [ ] Create frontend UI components
- [ ] Add JavaScript functionality
- [ ] Test integration between frontend and backend
- [ ] Ensure mobile responsiveness

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Feature works as described in the requirements
- [ ] UI is consistent with existing design patterns
- [ ] Feature is accessible to the correct user types
- [ ] Performance impact is minimal
- [ ] Feature works on desktop and mobile devices
- [ ] All edge cases are handled gracefully
- [ ] Existing functionality remains unaffected

### Implementation Guidelines
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions
- Reuse existing UI components and styles where possible
- Ensure proper error handling and user feedback
- Add appropriate loading states for async operations
- Consider accessibility (screen readers, keyboard navigation)
- Test thoroughly before considering the feature complete
