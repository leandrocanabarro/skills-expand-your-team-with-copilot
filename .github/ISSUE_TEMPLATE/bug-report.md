- [ ] Verify backend API responses are correct
- [ ] Test the issue across different browsers if relevant
- [ ] Identify the root cause in the codebase

### Technical Areas to Check
- [ ] Frontend JavaScript (`src/static/app.js`)
- [ ] Backend API routes (`src/backend/routers/`)
- [ ] Database operations (`src/backend/database.py`)
- [ ] HTML template structure (`src/static/index.html`)
- [ ] CSS styling issues (`src/static/styles.css`)
- [ ] Authentication flow (`src/backend/routers/auth.py`)

### Acceptance Criteria
